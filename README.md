# Sring-Boot-Maven-Rest-API

Create a maven spring boot application with four restful operations.  
The four operations should be a put, post, get, delete.  

1. Put - The put function should take a user object as a @RequestBody with the following fields - firstName, lastName, contactNumber and write this user object into a file  
2. Post - The post function should take a user object as a @RequestBody and update the file with new user details. 
3. Get - The get function to return the user object from the file. 
4. Delete - The delete function should delete the  user file. 5. Store the project in a git repository and push the git repository to bitbucket or GitHub and share the repository with us.  

Important Note: All the operations should save and retrieve data from a file not a database
